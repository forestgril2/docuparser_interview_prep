### Cloud Architecture
- Multi-region deployment strategy
- Primary, secondary, and disaster recovery regions
- Region selection criteria:
  * Data residency requirements
  * Latency requirements
  * Cost optimization
  * Compliance requirements

---

### Container Orchestration
- Kubernetes cluster setup
- Node pools and autoscaling
- Control plane management
- Worker node configuration
- Resource allocation strategies

---

### Service Mesh & API Gateway
- Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd):
  * Service discovery
  * Load balancing
  * Circuit breaking
  * Traffic management
- API Gateway (Kong/Ambassador):
  * Rate limiting
  * Authentication
  * Request routing
  * API versioning

---

### Data Storage Infrastructure
- Document Storage:
  * Object Storage (S3/GCS)
  * CDN for static content
  * Lifecycle policies
- Databases:
  * PostgreSQL (Main DB)
  * Redis (Caching)
  * Elasticsearch (Search)
  * Vector DB (Embeddings)
- Message Queue:
  * Kafka/RabbitMQ
  * Dead letter queues
  * Topic management

---

### AI/ML Infrastructure
- Model Serving:
  * GPU nodes (when needed)
  * Model registry
  * Inference endpoints
- Batch Processing:
  * Spark/Dask clusters
  * Batch schedulers
  * Resource optimization
- Feature Store:
  * Online features
  * Offline features
  * Feature versioning

---

### Observability Stack
- Metrics (Prometheus):
  * System metrics
  * Application metrics
  * Custom metrics
- Logging (ELK/Loki):
  * Centralized logging
  * Log aggregation
  * Log analysis
- Tracing (Jaeger):
  * Distributed tracing
  * Request flow tracking
  * Performance analysis
- Alerting (AlertManager):
  * Alert rules
  * Notification channels
  * Escalation policies

---

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Source Control (GitHub/GitLab):
  * Repository management
  * Branch strategies
  * Code review processes
- Build System:
  * Container registry
  * Artifact storage
  * Build optimization
- Testing:
  * Unit tests
  * Integration tests
  * Load tests
  * Security tests
- Deployment:
  * ArgoCD/Flux (GitOps)
  * Feature flags
  * Blue-green deployments
  * Canary releases
