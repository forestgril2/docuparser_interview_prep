### Document Processing System Design
- How would you design a system to handle:
  * Concurrent document processing
    
  * Scalable storage
  * Real-time status updates
  * Error handling and retries
- Key considerations:
  * Microservices architecture
  * Message queues
  * Event-driven design
  * State management
  * Failure recovery

---

### LLM Integration
- How would you integrate LLM capabilities?
- Considerations:
  * API integration patterns
  * Prompt engineering
  * Response processing
  * Error handling
  * Cost optimization

### AI-Powered Investigation System
- Project Management Layer:
  * Project Creator for investigation initialization
  * Budget and quota management
  * Success criteria tracking
  * Constraint management

- Theme Analysis Layer:
  * Human-AI collaboration interface
  * Theme extraction and weighting
  * Cross-theme relationship mapping
  * Priority management

- Agent Management Layer:
  * Agent Factory for dynamic agent creation
  * Agent templates and registry
  * Performance monitoring
  * Resource allocation

- Dynamic Database Layer:
  * Schema generation per theme
  * Cross-theme relationship mapping
  * Real-time data flow management
  * Consistency maintenance

- Cost Management Layer:
  * Real-time cost monitoring
  * Resource optimization
  * Budget adherence
  * Performance-cost balancing

### System Monitoring
- How would you implement:
  * Health checks
  * Performance metrics
  * Error tracking
  * Resource utilization
  * Alerting
